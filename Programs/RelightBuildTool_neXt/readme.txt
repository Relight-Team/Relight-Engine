RelightBuildTool neXt

RelightBuildTool neXt is a prototype of a replacement of RelightBuildTool. If this prototype prove successful, then it will fully replace the old RelightBuildTool and drop the "neXt" title.

Unlike the previous versions, which execute each content in a terminal system, this one was made to generates a project file and executes it

This will add the following:

- FINALLY adds support for splitting files from .h and .cpp files, with the header and implementation linking each other

- Allows IDE's to read and setup the codebase

- Makes intergrating SDK's and Platforms much easier

- No more Configuration files, all settings are either generated by default or are passed as a command argument
