here's an example of external code being used by the SDK in order to develop Relight Applications on said platform

this could be interpreted code, compiled code, executables, etc, and can be interacted with by Platform, PlatformSDK, PlatformFactory, Toolchain, and/or any other external code, and there can be as much as possible so long as it's connected in someway with PlatformFactory (such as child class or imported code)
